REM VIDEOGAME INSPIRED ORVILLE
REM
REM This code will draw the opening title of an fictious videogame,
REM about "The Orville", an American science fiction comedy drama.
REM 
REM With this example we try to outline an isomorphic way of writing 
REM programs and designing graphic resources, so that it is easier to 
REM port them from one platform to another. The aim, as always, is to 
REM guarantee a comparable visual and gaming experience between systems, 
REM without giving up the specificities of each.

REM ISPIRATI AI VIDEOGIOCHI TITOLI DI ORVILLE
REM 
REM Questo codice disegnerà il titolo di apertura di un videogioco
REM di fantasia, ispirato a "The Orville", la serie di fantascienza
REM statunitense.
REM
REM Con questo esempio proviamo a tracciare un modo isomorfo di scrivere 
REM programmi e disegnare risorse grafiche, affinché sia più facile 
REM portarli da una piattaforma all'altra. Lo scopo, come sempre, è 
REM garantire una esperienza visiva e di gioco paragonabile tra i sistemi,
REM senza rinunciare alle specificità di ognuno.
